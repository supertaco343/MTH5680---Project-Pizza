# MTH5680---Project-Pizza

## Project Description
This is a class project to demonstrate our knowledge of AI models.  The designed models are trained from scratch on pictures of pizzas in order to be able to classify pizzas.  

## Features
- Real time pizza identification
- Included pizza picture download script

## Tech Stack
**Backend** Python  
**Frontend** basic terminal interaction for input/output  
**AI Model** CNN (using Tensorflow, and attempt with Pytorch), KNN (Tensorflow)  

## Installation and Setup
This will assume you are using the "final" form of the project located in the Final Report folder.
1. Clone the repo:  
```
git clone https://github.com/supertaco343/MTH5680---Project-Pizza.git
cd MTH5680---Project-Pizza/Final_Report_-_Project_Pizza/Working_Model(s)
```
2. Download the dataset:  
This can be found at this google drive link: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1RSg6D4ToXdEenmmcXHBjTA7Hnp_7XqXT?usp=sharing  
3. Move the proper dataset:  
You will have to find the dataset you wish to use, the link above includes 3 different ones; AI generated images of pizzas, pizza images pulled from the internet, and a section of the MNIST numbers dataset.  You would most likely use the pizza images pulled from the internet (initially labeled "Manually Sorted Pizza").  Copy your selected dataset to the "Working Model(s)" folder you entered in step 1.
4. Run your selected model:  
You can now run either the cnn or knn models in Juypter Notebook.
